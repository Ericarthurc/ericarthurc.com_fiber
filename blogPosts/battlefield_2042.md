# Battlefield 2 - Shooting into the future

## General

Battlefield 2042 has blessed us with itself for almost a year now! Yay...Well luckily for me I didn't play it during its launch period and avoided the 90% Steam down voting crazy. My first general impressions is that the game is a game, and you can shoot people that are shooting at you... haha.

## Gameplay

How does this game feel? Well lets talk about mechanics and whatnot before touching the game engine, I will hit that in the next category. So lets look at Battlefield 4, 1, and V real quick. These are all very classic Battlefield with the same/similar mechanics. You have the four classes each with their own set of rules and play styles. We would call this 'meta'; meta is the way the game forces a player to play or conform their style to. Medics can heal but they don't get snipers and heavy weaponry. I wont go into all the classes but thats the idea; there is a 'meta' that you play to. So here comes Battlefield 2042... and bye bye meta for the most part. And I should really say bye bye to the old meta, because every game has a meta. In 2042 you are no longer locked to the way a class plays and are not semi-locked to the character you pick. Each character has a special set of perks and a unique item they carry. So now you can spawn in as a support-like character with the ability to revive people but use a sniper rifle, as an example. Again I don't want to dive through all this stuff, we would be here for days. My game posts are mainly about the 'feel' of a game as that's what I care about. So gameplay wise, the meta is a lot different now and you actually have a lot of freedom. I am going to say that is a good thing and a plus to the game; but many Battlefield purists don't like this.

## Engine

Alright let's talk about this engine... Let me rate it right off the bat, B-. And for comparison, I would give Battlefield I a A+. And also keep in mind, this is pretty much the same Frostbite engine... so what happened to lower the rating. Let me say, this game looks good, it even looks great... but then at the same time it looks bad. You'll be running down a path and look around and everything looks really good, and then look over to an area a little ways from you and it looks like hot garbage. I am going to pin this on TAA (Temporal anti-aliasing), it is hot garbage and Dice/EA love it for their games. I mean it looks okay... and has been fine on older games, but in 2042 it is forced on and I am not a fan. It's a blurry form of anti-aliasing to me, not as bad as FXAA, but still not my favorite. I would have preferred to see MSAA in there ðŸ˜”.

Now lets talk about framerates and all that goodness. This is where the engine looses more points with me. And I want to blame the map design for this. I have played a good amount of this game, have played all the maps multiple times and I watch my framerate with `perfoverlay.drawfps true`. FRAMERATES ARE NOT CONSISTENT BETWEEN MAPS!!! I have seen differences of over 20 frames per second on certain maps... this is bad, really bad. And this is not a GPU, green vs red (and I guess blue now haha... rip Intel ARC), thing. This is happening for a lot of people across the GPU space. I am rocking a 6900XT and playing at 1440p and sometimes see around 130fps, then will see 95fps on a different map O_o. They need to get this fixed ASAP! Luckily I have a Freesync monitor and this is not a huge issue for me, but not great.

The game does offer a basic dynamic resolution target adjuster setting, which will lower your resolution scale in real-time to keep you at your target framerate. I love this technology and I am very happy developers are starting to use it! Good stuff! We are only going to see native support for Nvidia's DLSS here and no AMD upscaling options which is unfortunate, but great for Nvidia users. The reason I bring up these AI scaling options and resolution modifiers is this game is very hard on our GPS buddies. Anything not at least newer than two generations old will struggle at 1440p, not to mention 4K lol. I think this is really engine optimizations that could be worked out in the future if Dice/EA try hard here, but probably not. So let me rate the engine now, a solid B- again lol.

## Bugs

This games got some bugs, it was born with bugs in it's teeth. But they have worked pretty hard on fixing a lot of them. The game is definitely playable and enjoyable at this current state. I have seen some weird bugs while playing those.

- Instantly dying to nothing (this happens way to much lol)
- Massive map glitches where it looks like a mountain is on a building haha!
- Weird framerate spots (in my mind this could be a bug)

And these are just a few I have had commonly, there are definitely more bugs but I guess they weren't a big enough deal to me to remember them right now.

## Overall

So here comes the money... the FINAL RATING!! Can you guess it haha... In my opinion, in the current state, Battlefield 2042 is a B- game. It is fun and enjoyable and I bought it for only $27, so I guess I am the real winner here. I mean I think its worth $60 right now for sure, but I get to ride on that nice Steam rating and get me a good ol' Steam sale haha. Fun game, will be playing a lot more. I enjoy the new meta, and not being locked to a 'role' per sa. Thanks for reading this not very in depth review on Battlefield 2042 haha!
